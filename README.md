_SwiftUIPager_ provides  a `Pager` component built with SwiftUI native components. `Pager` is a view that renders a scrollable container to display a handful of pages. These pages are recycled on scroll, so you don't have to worry about memory issues. `Pager` will load just a handful of items, enough to beatifully scroll along.

Create vertical or horizontal pagers, align the cards, change the direction of the scroll, animate the pagination... `Pager` lets you do anything you want.

## Known Issues
* `NavigationLink` and `Button` might work oddly with `Pager` if `pagingPriority(.simultaneous)` is used in _SwiftUI 1.0_ and _iOS 13_. This issue isn't reproducible in _iOS 14 beta_. For more information, follow this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58440469/swiftui-navigationlink-and-scrollview-drag-gesture-colliding).
* Depending on the _Xcode_ version, you might run into a precondition failure affecting _SwiftUI 1.0_ and _iOS 13_. This issue doesn't occur on _Xcode 12 beta_. For more information about workarounds, see _Precondition failure: invalid value type for attribute [#60](https://github.com/fermoya/SwiftUIPager/issues/60)_.
